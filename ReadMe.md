# Throwaway GitHub Repository

This is just a place where I am learning about working with GitHub repositories.

A Markup file (.md) is a text file that uses *Markup syntax* to produce a document that others can read when they check out your repository.

I hope to learn the following:

- How to make a repositories.
- How to publish a repositories using GitHub Desktop.
- How to make commits to a repository.

Let's give it a go :) Also try out [Introduction to GitHub] (https://github.github.io/on-demand) to learn more.
